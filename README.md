# Guess-the-number
Basic guessing game in python!

Hey Folks!
 This is my first commit and first repository on Github.
 I have experimented a little and came up with an idea of a basic guessing game in python.
 A random number would be generted and you have to guess that nubmer 'n' until you have correctly guessed the number. Meanwhile    guessing the number the program would help you to tell if the number you guessed is more than the random number or less.
